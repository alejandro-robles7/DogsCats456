# DogsCats456
Create an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats


## Purpose:

1. Develop your Deep Learning model in Python with Keras
2. Understand Deep learning structures and their potentials


##Task Description:

In this homework, you’re asked to use Deep Learning to handle a Dogs vs. Cats classification problem. The data we use is from a real Kaggle competition, https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/overview The specific tasks are • Use Python and Keras to build your own Deep Learning structure. • Please split the given training set onto 80% training, 20% validation. • Train your model using Alexnet /VGG models. • Show your training, validation loss and accuracy for different iterations.

##What to Submit?
A completed iPython notebook onto BeachBoard (Note: properly comment each code line)
